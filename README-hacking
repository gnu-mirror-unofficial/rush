These notes intend to help people working on the Git version of GNU Rush.
See end of file for copying conditions.

* Requirements

If you have taken the sources from Git you will need the following
packages to build GNU Rush.  I don't make any extra effort to accommodate
older versions of these packages, so please make sure that you have the
latest stable version.

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Gnulib <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/>

* Bootstrapping

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to check out
the project from Git. The next step is to get other files needed to build,
which are extracted from other source packages: 

1. Change to the source tree directory

   cd rush

2. Run

   ./bootstrap 

Once done, proceed as described in the file README (section
INSTALLATION).

Normally you will have to run bootstrap only once. However, if you
intend to hack on GNU Rush, you might need to run it again later. In
this case, you will probably want to save some time and bandwidth by
avoiding downloading the same files again. If so, create in the project's
root directory a file named `.bootstrap' with the following
contents:

   --gnulib-srcdir=$HOME/gnulib

Replace `$HOME/gnulib' with the actual directory where the Gnulib
sources reside.

For more information about `bootstrap', run `bootstrap --help'.
