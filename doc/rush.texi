@node Intro
@chapter Introduction
  GNU Rush is a Restricted User Shell, designed for sites that provide
limited remote access to their resources, such as svn or git
repositories, scp, or the like.  Using a sophisticated configuration
file, GNU Rush gives you complete control over the command lines that
users execute, as well as over the usage of system resources, such as
virtual memory, CPU time, etc.

@node Operation
@chapter Operation
  GNU Rush is usually installed as a user shell.  When a user connects to
the server (e.g. by using using SSH protocol), the shell binary,
@command{rush}, is executed.  GNU Rush must be called with exactly two
arguments: the @option{-c} command line option and a command line to
be executed on the host machine@footnote{Starting from version 1.6, it
is possible to use GNU Rush for interactive shell
sessions.  @xref{Interactive}, for more information about it.}.  If
wrong arguments are supplied, the shell aborts.

@cindex request
  The third argument to @command{rush} supplies a command line to be
executed.  This command line along with the shell environment for its
execution and the password database entry for the user who executes
@command{rush} are said to form a @dfn{request}.

@cindex rule
@cindex conditions
@cindex actions
  After startup, @command{rush} reads a set of @dfn{rules} from its
configuration file.  Each rule consists of matching conditions
and actions.  @dfn{Conditions} decide whether the request matches
the rule.  They can include regular expression matching against entire
command line or particular words thereof, comparisons of user name or
group,, etc.  If all conditions match the request, actions are
executed.  @dfn{Actions} can instruct @command{rush} to:

@itemize @bullet
@item Modify the command line;
@item Impose resource limits;
@item Set umask;
@item Change current working directory;
@item Modify the execution environment;
@item Run command in a special root directory (@samp{chroot}).
@end itemize

  Finally, after all actions have been executed successfully, @command{rush}
executes the requested command.  Notice, that by that time the
resulting command line is not necessarily the same as the original one
supplied to @command{rush} with the @option{-c} option.

@cindex fall-through rule
@cindex rule, fall-through
  A special kind of rules, called @dfn{fall-through} ones, is
provided.  Fall-through rules differ from other rules in that they do
not execute the command.  After all actions in a fall-through rule
have been executed, GNU Rush continues to search for another matching rule
in its configuration and applies it, if found.  Fall-through rules
are useful to set default values for subsequent rules.

@node Quick Start
@chapter Quick Start
  To give you the feel of GNU Rush possibilities, let's consider the
following configuration file rule:

@smallexample
@group
rule sftp
  # Matching condition
  match $uid >= 100 && $command ~ "^.*/sftp-server"
  # Actions:
  set [0] = "bin/sftp-server"
  umask 002
  chroot "~"
  chdir "/"
@end group
@end smallexample

  The first clause, @code{rule}, defines a new rule.  Its argument
serves as a rule tag, used for diagnostic messages and for accounting.

  Lines beginning with @samp{#} are comments, they are intended for a
human reader and are ignored by @code{rush}.

  The @code{match} statement, defines condition that must be met for
this rule to become active.  In this example it requests that the
UID of the requesting user be greater than or equal to 100, and the
command line begin with @samp{/sftp-server}, optionally preceded by
arbitrary directory components.

  Subsequent clauses define actions associated with this rule.

  The @code{set} clause contains instructions on how to
modify the first argument of the command line.  Argument indices start
at 0, so @samp{[0]} refers to the command name.  The expression in our example
instructs GNU Rush to replace it with @samp{bin/sftp-server}.

  The @code{umask} clause sets the file creation mask.

  The @code{chroot} clause instructs GNU Rush to chroot to the user home
directory before executing the command.

  Finally, the @code{chdir} statement sets the directory to change to
after installing the chroot.

@node Configuration File
@chapter Configuration File
@flindex rush.rc
  The configuration file @file{rush.rc} is located in
@file{/usr/local/etc} by default.@footnote{The exact location of the
configuration file is defined when configuring the package.  See the
file @file{INSTALL} in the GNU Rush source directory for more information}.

  The configuration file is read and parsed right after start up.  Any
errors occurred in parsing are reported using @code{syslog} facility
@samp{authpriv} and priority @samp{notice}.  When run in @samp{test}
mode, all diagnostics is displayed on standard error
output.  @xref{Test Mode}, for a detailed description of ways to debug
and test your configurations.

@anchor{security checks}
  Before parsing, @command{rush} checks the ownership and permissions
of the configuration file for possible security breaches.  The
configuration file is considered unsafe if any of the following
conditions are met:

@enumerate 1
@item It is not owned by root.
@item It is group writable.
@item It is world writable.
@item It resides in a group writable directory.
@item It resides in a world writable directory.
@item It is a symbolic link to a file residing in a group or world
writable directory.
@end enumerate

If the file is considered unsafe, @command{rush} rejects it and aborts
execution.

Any of these tests can be disabled using the
@command{--security-check} option (@pxref{--security-check}).

  As of version @value{VERSION}, @command{rush} supports two distinct
configuration file formats.

@cindex legacy syntax
@cindex syntax, legacy
  The @dfn{legacy} configuration format is the one used in rush
versions up to 1.9.  It is still supported to facilitate transition of
existing installations to the new syntax.  Its support will be removed
in future versions.  The legacy syntax is described in detail in
@uref{http://www.gnu.org.ua/software/rush/manual/1.x}.

  This manual describes new configuration file format.

@node Lexical Structure
@section Lexical Structure of the Configuration File
  Configuration file consist of tokens separated by arbitrary amount
of whitespace characters: horizontal spaces and tabs.  Except when
enclosed in double quotes, the @samp{#} character introduces an inline
comment: the character itself and any material following it up to the
end of the physical line is ignored.  Comments are treated as newlines.

@anchor{word}
@anchor{token}
The following classes of tokens are recognized.

@table @dfn
@item Newlines
A newline character (ASCII 10) terminates a statement.  If immediately
preceded by a backslash, both backslash and newline are removed and
the following line is treated as continuation of the current line.
This allows for splitting exceedingly long statements over several
physical lines.

@cindex identifiers, configuration
@item Identifiers
Identifiers begin with a letter and consist of letters, digits,
underscores and dashes.  They serve as keywords and variable names.

@item Decimal numbers
A sequence of decimal digits, optionally preceded by a minus or plus
sign.

@cindex unquoted strings
@item Unquoted strings
An unquoted string is any contiguous sequence of any characters,
except newlines, whitespace and the following special characters:
@samp{\}, @samp{"}, @samp{!}, @samp{=}, @samp{<}, @samp{>}, @samp{(},
@samp{)}, @samp{@{}, @samp{@}}, @samp{[}, @samp{]}, @samp{$},
@samp{%}, @samp{&}, @samp{|}, @samp{~}, @samp{#}.

@cindex quoted strings
@item Quoted strings
A quoted string is a sequence of characters enclosed in
double-quotes.  Quoted strings are subject to backslash
interpretation, backreference interpretation and variable
expansion.

@cindex backslash interpretation
During the @dfn{backslash interpretation}, the @dfn{escape sequences}
are recognized and replaced as per table below:

@float Table, backslash-interpretation
@caption{Backslash escapes}
@multitable @columnfractions 0.30 .5
@item Sequence @tab Replaced with
@item \a @tab Audible bell character (@acronym{ASCII} 7)
@item \b @tab Backspace character (@acronym{ASCII} 8)
@item \f @tab Form-feed character (@acronym{ASCII} 12)
@item \n @tab Newline character (@acronym{ASCII} 10)
@item \r @tab Carriage return character (@acronym{ASCII} 13)
@item \t @tab Horizontal tabulation character (@acronym{ASCII} 9)
@item \v @tab Vertical tabulation character (@acronym{ASCII} 11)
@item \\ @tab Single backslash character
@item \" @tab Double-quote
@item \% @tab Percent character
@end multitable
@end float

The backslash immediately followed by newline character is removed.
When followed by any other character except as listed above, both the
backslash and the character are retained verbatim.

@cindex backreference interpretation
@anchor{backreference}
During @dfn{backreference interpretation}, references to parenthesized
groups in regular expression are replaced with the actual content of
the corresponding group in the most recently matched string.  A
reference is @samp{%@{@var{n}@}} where @var{n} is a decimal number.  If
@var{n} is one digit, curly braces can be omitted: @samp{%@var{n}}.
If the @samp{%} character results from previous backslash
interpretation, no backreference interpretation occurs.

Strings used in the left-hand side of a comparison expression are
subject to variable expansion.  This is discussed in detail in
@ref{Variable expansion}.

@item Variable references
Variable references consist of a @samp{$} sign, followed by the
positional argument number or variable name, optionally enclosed in
curly braces.  Positional arguments greater than 9 must be enclosed in
curly braces.  The variable name must follow the rules for valid
identifiers: it must begin with a letter and consist of letters,
digits and underscores.  Variable name in curly braces can be followed
by @samp{-}, @samp{=}, @samp{?}, or @samp{+}, optionally preceded by
@samp{:} as summarized in the table below:

@float Table, variable references
@caption{Variable reference}
@multitable @columnfractions 0.30 .5
@item Reference @tab Meaning
@item $@{@var{var}:-@var{word}@} @tab  Use Default Values
@item $@{@var{var}:=@var{word}@} @tab  Assign Default Values
@item $@{@var{var}:?@var{word}@} @tab  Display Error if Null or Unset
@item $@{@var{var}:+@var{word}@} @tab  Use Alternate Value
@end multitable
@end float

Where @var{word} stands for any valid token as described in this
section.  @xref{Variable expansion}, for a detailed discussion of
these forms and their meaning.

@anchor{operator}
@item Comparison and boolean operators
These are:

@float Table, Operators
@caption{Operators}
@multitable @columnfractions 0.30 .5
@item @samp{&&}      @tab Boolean @dfn{and}
@item @samp{||}      @tab Boolean @dfn{or}
@item @samp{!}       @tab Boolean negation
@item @samp{==}      @tab Equality (string or numeric)
@item @samp{!=}      @tab Inequality (string or numeric)

@item @samp{=}       @tab Assignment
@item @samp{=~}      @tab Regular expression substitution
@end multitable
@end float

@xref{Matching Conditions}, for a detailed discussion.
@end table

@node Syntax
@section Syntax
@cindex syntax, configuration files
@cindex configuration file syntax
  The @samp{rush} configuration consists of @dfn{statements}.

  A @dfn{statement} consists of a keyword and optional arguments,
separated by any amount of whitespace.  Each statement occupies one
line in the configuration file and is terminated by newline character.
Extremely long statements may be split across several physical lines
by ending each line except the last with a backslash followed by a
newline.

  Statements may be separated by any amount of empty lines or comments.

@cindex syntax version statement
@cindex @code{rush}, statement
  The first statement in a configuration file indicates the syntax
version.  It has the following form:

@example
rush 2.0
@end example

  This statement is mandatory.  In its absence, the file will be
treated as legacy configuration file.

  Statements that follow form logical groups.  Each group begins
with a @code{rule} or @code{global} statement.

The @code{global} statement introduces global settings.  It affects
all statements that follow it.

The @code{rule} statement introduces a single @command{rush} rule,
that defines how to process a particular command.

These statements are described in the sections that follow.

@node Global
@section The @code{global} statement
@cindex @code{global}
  The @code{global} statement defines global settings.  The syntax is:

@example
  global
    @var{stmt1}
    @var{stmt2}
    ...
@end example

where dots represent any number of statements.  The following
subsections discuss the statements that can be used within a
@code{global} block.

* Debugging::
* sleep-time::

@end menu

@node Expansion control
@subsection Expansion control

The following statement controls the behavior of @command{rush} when
an undefined variable is expanded (@pxref{Variable expansion}).

@deffn {global} expand-undefined @var{bool}
If @var{bool} is @samp{true}, expand undefined variables to empty
value.  If it is @samp{false} (the default), issue an error and abort.

The following values can be used as a synonym for @samp{true}:
@samp{yes}, @samp{on}, @samp{t}, @samp{1}.

The following values can be used as a synonym for @samp{false}:
@samp{no}, @samp{off}, @samp{nil}, @samp{0}.
@end deffn

@xref{handling of undefined variables}, for a detailed discussion of
how @command{rush} processes undefined variables and for the
recommended techniques of handling them.

@node Debugging
@subsection Debugging
@cindex debugging
  The @code{debug} global statement sets the @dfn{debugging level} -- an
integer value that controls the verbosity of @command{rush}:

@deffn {global} debug @var{num}
Set debugging level to @var{num}.
@end deffn

  The greater @var{num} is, the more verbose is the logging.  The
debugging information is reported via @code{syslog} at facility
@samp{authpriv}, priority @samp{debug}.  As of version @value{VERSION},
the following debugging levels are supported:

@cindex debugging levels
@table @asis
@item 1
A minimum debugging level, and the only one whose messages are logged
using the priority @samp{notice}.  At this level, @command{rush} only
logs requests and rules selected to handle them.  For example:

@smallexample
rush[16821]: Serving request "/usr/libexec/sftp-server"
for sergiusz by rule sftp-savane
@end smallexample

@item 2
List all actions executed when serving requests.

@item 3
Verbosely describe parsing of the configuration file.
@end table

  More debugging levels may be implemented in future.

@node sleep-time
@subsection The @code{sleep-time} statement

@deffn {global} sleep-time @var{num}
Set the time in seconds to sleep before exiting on error.
This statement is intended as a measure against brute-force attacks.
Default sleep time is 5 seconds.
@end deffn

@node Error Messages
@subsection Error Messages
@cindex error messages

@deffn {global} message @var{class} @var{text}
Define a textual message which is returned to the remote party if an
error of the given @var{class} occurs.
@end deffn

Valid values for @var{class} are:

@table @asis
@cindex @code{usage-error}
@item usage-error
This error is reported when @command{rush} has been invoked
improperly.  The default text is:

@smallexample
You are not permitted to execute this command.
@end smallexample

@cindex nologin-error
@item nologin-error
Define a textual message which is returned to the remote user if
there is no such user name in the password database.

Default is:

@smallexample
You do not have interactive login access to this machine.
@end smallexample

@cindex @code{config-error}
@item config-error
Define a textual message which is returned to the remote party if the
@command{rush} configuration file contains errors.

Default is:

@smallexample
Local configuration error occurred.
@end smallexample

@cindex @code{system-error}
@item system-error
Define a textual message which is returned to the remote party if
a system error occurs.

Default message is:

@smallexample
A system error occurred while attempting to execute command.
@end smallexample
@end table

@node regexp
@subsection The @code{regexp} statement
@cindex regular expressions
@cindex extended regular expressions
@cindex basic regular expressions
The @code{regexp} statement configures the flavor of regular
expressions for use by subsequent @code{match} and
@code{set} statements.

@deffn {global} regexp @var{flags} ...
Configure the type of regular expressions.
@end deffn

Each @var{flag} is word specifying some regular expression
feature.  It can be preceded by @samp{+} to enable this feature (this
is the default), or by @samp{-} to disable it.  Valid flags are:

@table @samp
@item extended
Use @acronym{POSIX} Extended Regular Expression syntax when
interpreting regex.  This is the default.

@item basic
Use basic regular expressions.  Equivalent to @samp{-extended}.

@item icase
@itemx ignore-case
Do not differentiate case.  Subsequent regex matches will be case
insensitive.
@end table

For example, the following statement enables @acronym{POSIX} extended,
case insensitive matching:

@smallexample
global
  regex +extended +icase
@end smallexample

@node include-security
@subsection The @code{include-security} statement

Additional configuration can be included to the main configuration
file using the @code{include} statement (@pxref{Include}).  Before
inclusion, a number of checks is performed on the file to ensure it
is safe to rely on it.  These checks are configured using the
following statement:

@deffn {global} include-security @var{list}
Configure the security checks for include files.  This statement takes
a list of arguments, separated by white space.  The following
arguments are recognized:

@table @asis
@cindex @code{all}, include security flag
@item all
Enable all checks.

@cindex @code{owner}, include security flag
@item owner
The file is not owned by root.

@cindex @code{iwgrp}, include security flag
@cindex @code{groupwritablefile}, include security flag
@item iwgrp
@itemx groupwritablefile
The file is group writable.

@cindex @code{iwoth}, include security flag
@cindex @code{worlwritablefile}, include security flag
@item iwoth
@itemx worldwritablefile
The file is world writable.

@cindex @code{dir_iwgrp}, include security flag
@cindex @code{groupwritabledir}, include security flag
@item dir_iwgrp
@itemx groupwritabledir
The file resides in a group writable directory.

@cindex @code{dir_iwoth}, include security flag
@cindex @code{worldwritabledir}, include security flag
@item dir_iwoth
@itemx worldwritabledir
The file resides in a world writable directory.

@cindex @code{link}, include security flag
@item link
The file is a symbolic link to a file residing in a group or world
writable directory.
@end table
@end deffn

Each of the above keywords may be prefixed by @samp{no}, which
reverses its meaning.  The special keyword @samp{none} disables all
checks.  Each keyword adds or removes a particular test to the
existing check list, which is initialized as described in
@ref{security checks}.  Thus, the following statement results in all
checks, except for the file ownership:

@smallexample
global
  include-security noowner
@end smallexample

In the example below, the check list is first cleared by using the
@code{none} statement, and then a set of checks is added to it:

@smallexample
global
  include-security none owner iwoth iwgrp
@end smallexample

@node Accounting control
@subsection Accounting control statements

The following global statements control file mode and permissions of
the @dfn{accounting database files}.  For a detailed description of
this feature, @xref{Accounting Database}.

@deffn {global} acct-umask @var{mask}
Set umask used when accessing accounting database files.  Default
value is @samp{022}.
@end deffn

@deffn {global} acct-dir-mode @var{mode}
Set mode bits for the accounting directory.  The @var{mode} argument
is the mode in octal.
@end deffn

@deffn {global} acct-file-mode @var{mode}
Set mode bits for @file{wtmp} and @file{utmp} files.
@end deffn

@node Rule
@section Rule
@cindex @code{rule}
  The @code{rule} statement configures a GNU @command{rush} rule.
This is a @dfn{block} statement, which means that all statements
located between it and the next @code{rule} statement (or end of file,
whichever occurs first) modify the definition of that rule.

  The syntax of the @code{rule} statement is:

@deffn {Configuration} rule @var{tag}
@end deffn

@cindex rule tag
@cindex tag, rule
The @var{tag} argument is optional.  If it is given, it supplies a
@dfn{tag} for the rule, i.e. a (presumably unique) identifier, which
is used to label this rule.  @command{Rush} uses this tag in its diagnostic
messages.  For rules without explicit @var{tag}, @command{Rush} supplies a
default tag, which is constructed by concatenating @samp{#} character
and the ordinal number of rule in the configuration file, in decimal
notation.  Rule numbering starts from @samp{1}.

Each rule group can contain a number of statements that control what
kind of requests match that rule and what actions are taken when the
rule is matched.  Arguments to this statements can refer to command
line arguments and other parts of the request.

@node Positional variables
@subsubsection Positional variables

@anchor{indexing}
@cindex word splitting
@cindex indexing, words in command line
  Rush performs word splitting using the same rules as @command{sh}.
Configuration statement refer to command line arguments (words) by
their @dfn{index}, using @dfn{positional variables}.  A positional
variable can have the following forms:

@example
 $@var{n}
 $@{@var{n}@}
@end example

@noindent
where @var{n} is the variable index.  The form with curly braces must
be used if @var{n} is negative (see below) or greater than 9.

Positional indexes start at @samp{0}.  Thus, the variable @samp{$0}
refers to the command name.  Consider, for example, the following
command line:

@smallexample
/bin/scp -t /upload
@end smallexample

Word splitting phase results in three positional variables being defined:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.3 0.7
@headitem Variable @tab Value
@item $0 @tab /bin/scp
@item $1 @tab -t
@item $2 @tab /upload
@end multitable

  These values can also be referred to using negative indexes.  They
refer to words in the reverse order, as illustrated in the following
table (notice the use of curly braces):

@multitable @columnfractions 0.3 0.7
@headitem Variable @tab Value
@item $@{-3@} @tab /bin/scp
@item $@{-2@} @tab -t
@item $@{-1@} @tab /upload
@end multitable

  Notice also, that negative indexes are 1-based.

One final note about the @samp{$0} variable.  Immediately after word
splitting it refers to both the executable program name and the 0th
argument that will be passed to that program (@code{argv[0]}).  Most
of the time the two values coincide.  However, the rule can modify
either value, so that they become different.  Whether modified or not,
the actual name of the program to be run is kept in the request
variable @samp{$program} (see the following section).

@node Request variables
@subsubsection Request variables

The following variables can be used to refer to various parts of the
user request:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.3 0.7
@headitem Variable   @tab Expansion
@vindex user
@item $user          @tab User name
@vindex group
@item $group         @tab Name of the user's principal group
@vindex uid
@item $uid           @tab UID
@vindex gid
@item $gid           @tab GID
@vindex home
@item $home          @tab User's home directory
@vindex gecos
@item $gecos         @tab User's @acronym{GECOS} field
@vindex program
@item $program       @tab Executable program name
@vindex command
@item $command       @tab Entire command line
@vindex $argc
@item $argc          @tab Number of arguments in @samp{$command}
@end multitable

@node User-defined variables
@subsubsection User-defined variables

In addition to the built-in variables, arbitrary variables can be
defined and used in the configuration file.  These @dfn{user-defined}
variables are defined using the @code{set} statement (@pxref{set}) and
accessed using the same syntax as the built-in variables.

User-defined variables are normally used to pass information between
rules.  They are invisible to whatever command @command{rush} executes
as the final result of processing.

@node Variable expansion
@subsubsection Variable Expansion

Some words in the configuration file undergo variable expansion prior
to their use.  During variable expansion, any references to variables
in the string are replaced with their actual values.  A variable
reference has two basic forms:

@example
  $@var{v}
  $@{@var{v}@}
@end example

@noindent
where @var{v} is either the name of the variable (request or
user-defined), or the index of the positional variable.  The notation
in curly braces serves several purposes.  First, it is obligatory if
@var{v} is an index of the positional variable that is negative or
greater than 9.  Secondly, it should be used if the variable
reference is immediately followed by an alphanumeric symbol, which
will otherwise be considered part of it (as in @samp{$@{home@}dir}).
Finally, this form allows for specifying the action to take if the
variable is undefined or expands to an empty value:

@table @asis
@item $@{@var{variable}:-@var{word}@}
@dfn{Use Default Values}.  If @var{variable} is unset or null, the expansion
of @var{word} is  substituted.  Otherwise, the value of @var{variable} is
substituted.

@item $@{@var{variable}:=@var{word}@}
@dfn{Assign Default Values}.  If @var{variable} is unset or null, the
expansion  of @var{word} is assigned to variable.  The value of
@var{variable} is then substituted.

@item $@{@var{variable}:?@var{word}@}
@dfn{Display Error if Null or Unset}.  If @var{variable} is null or unset,
the expansion of @var{word} (or a message to that effect if @var{word} is
not present) is output to the current logging channel.  Otherwise, the
value of @var{variable} is substituted.

@item $@{@var{variable}:+@var{word}@}
@dfn{Use Alternate Value}.  If @var{variable} is null or unset, nothing is
substituted, otherwise the expansion of @var{word} is substituted.
@end table

These constructs test for a variable that is unset or null.  Omitting
the colon results in a test only for a variable that is unset.

@anchor{handling of undefined variables}
@cindex expansion of undefined variables
@cindex undefined variable, expansion
If an undefined variable is encountered during variable expansion, the
default @command{rush} behavior is to report the error of
@samp{config-error} class (@pxref{Error Messages}) and exit.  To
gracefully handle such cases, use the @dfn{default value construct},
defined above.  For example, the following statement safely appends
the string @samp{/opt/man} to the value of the @env{MANPATH}
environment variable:

@example
setenv MANPATH = "$@{MANPATH:-""@}$@{MANPATH:+:@}/opt/man"
@end example

@noindent
The @samp{$@{MANPATH:-""@}} reference ensures no error is reported if
the variable is undefined.  The @samp{$@{MANPATH:+:@}} reference
appends a semicolon to the value, if the variable is defined.  Finally
the string @samp{/opt/man} is appended to the resulting value.

Another way to gracefully handle undefined variables, is to use the
@code{expand-undefined} global setting.  If you place the following
statement at the beginning of your configuration file, any undefined
variable will be silently expanded to empty string:

@example
global
  expand-undefined true
@end example

This statement affects variable expansion in statements that follow it
in the configuration file.  So you can place it in some point after
which this behavior is needed, and then disable it where it is no
longer desired, by using the following global statement:

@example
global
  expand-undefined false
@end example

@node Matching Conditions
@subsection Matching Conditions
@cindex matching conditions
@cindex conditions

@deffn {rule} match @var{expr}
  The @code{match} statement defines conditions that decide whether
the rule matches the particular request.  Its argument is a simple
expression or a boolean expression involving several simple
expressions.

@node Comparisons
@subsubsection Comparisons
@cindex comparison
A @dfn{simple comparison} is:

@example
@var{lhs} @var{op} @var{rhs}
@end example

@noindent
here, @var{lhs} (@dfn{left-hand side}) is a string (quoted or
unquoted), or variable reference (@pxref{Lexical Structure}),
@var{rhs} (@dfn{right-hand side}) is a string, and @var{op} is one of
the following binary operators:

@float Table, Comparison Operators
@caption{Comparison Operators}
@multitable @columnfractions 0.30 .5
@item @samp{==}      @tab Equality (string or numeric)
@item @samp{!=}      @tab Inequality (string or numeric)
@item @samp{<}       @tab Less than
@item @samp{<=}      @tab Less than or equal to
@item @samp{>}       @tab Greater than
@item @samp{>=}      @tab Greater than or equal to
@item @samp{~}       @tab Regexp matching
@item @samp{!~}      @tab Negated regexp matching
@end multitable
@end float

Prior to evaluating a simple expression, its left-hand side
undergoes variable expansion.  In contrast, the right-hand side is
always treated verbatim.

For example the following rule will match any request with 2 or more
arguments (recall, that the command name itself is counted as one of
the arguments):

@example
rule
  match $argc >= 2
@end example

The @samp{==} and @samp{!=} can operate both on strings and on
numbers.  When applied to strings the @samp{==} means byte-to-byte
equality, e.g.

@example
  match $0 == "/bin/ls"
@end example

@noindent
will match requests with @samp{/bin/ls} as the command name.

The @samp{~} and @samp{!~} operators implement @dfn{regular expression
matching}.  E.g.

@example
  match $command ~ "^scp (-v )?-t /incoming/(alpha|ftp)"
@end example

The @samp{!~} evaluates to @samp{true} if @var{lhs} does not match the
regular expression in the @var{rhs}.

If the regular expression contains parenthesized groups, the
subsequent commands can refer to the strings that matched the groups
using the @dfn{backreference notation} @samp{%@var{n}}, where @var{n}
is 1-based index ordinal number of the group in the regular expression
(@pxref{backreference}).  For example:

@example
rule chdir
  match $command "^cd (.+) && (.+)"
  chdir %1
  set command = %2
  fall-through
@end example

It splits the compound command into the working directory and the
command itself.  Then it remembers the name of the working directory
(first parenthesized group -- @samp{%1}) for changing to it later
(@pxref{chdir}) and resets the command line to the part of the
string that follows the @samp{&&} token.  Finally, it passes control
to another rules (@pxref{Fall-through}).

@node Membership operators
@subsubsection Membership operators
Membership operators check if their argument is a member of some
set of values.  There are two such operators.

@kwindex @samp{in}, operator
@example
@var{lhs} in ( @var{args} )
@end example

  The @code{in} operator evaluates to @samp{true} if @var{lhs} is
listed in @var{args}, which is a whitespace-separated list of strings.
For example:

@example
  match $0 in ("scp" "rsync")
@end example

@kwindex @samp{member}
@example
member @var{string}
member ( @var{args} )
@end example

 The @code{member} operator evaluates to @samp{true} if the requesting
user is a member of at least one group listed in its right-hand side.

@node Boolean expressions
@subsubsection Boolean expressions
  Simple expressions can be combined into complex conditions using
boolean operators:

@float Table, Boolean Operators
@caption{Boolean Operators}
@multitable @columnfractions 0.30 .5
@item @samp{||}      @tab Disjunction (@dfn{or})
@item @samp{&&}      @tab Conjunction (@dfn{and})
@item @samp{!}       @tab Negation
@end multitable
@end float

Arguments to these operators can be either simple expressions or
another boolean expressions.  The operators in the table above are
ordered by their precedence.  As in most programming languages,
parentheses can be used to enforce the desired order of evaluation.

Both binary operators implement shortcut evaluation.

@node set
@subsubsection The @code{set} statement

The @code{set} statement modifies the value of a positional, request,
or user-defined variable.

@deffn {rule} set @var{name} = @var{value}
@deffnx {rule} set [@var{n}] = @var{value}
Sets the variable @var{name} to @var{value}.  Prior to use,
@var{value} undergoes backreference interpretation
(@pxref{backreference}) and variable expansion (@pxref{Variable
expansion}).

The second form assigns to the positional variable @samp{$@var{n}}.
It is defined in more detail in @ref{Transformations}.
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} set @var{name} = @var{value} ~ @var{s-expr}
@deffnx {rule} set [@var{n}] = @var{value} ~ @var{s-expr}
Applies the @command{sed} search-and-replace expression @var{s-expr}
to @var{value} and assigns the result to the variable @var{name} or
argument @var{n}.  Both @var{value} and @var{s-expr} are subject to
variable expansion.
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} set @var{name} =~ @var{s-expr}
@deffnx {rule} set [@var{n}] =~ @var{s-expr}
Applies the @command{sed}-like search-and-replace expression
@var{s-expr} to the current value of the variable @var{name} and
stores the resulting string as its new value.  Prior to use,
@var{s-expr} undergoes backreference interpretation
(@pxref{backreference}) and variable expansion (@pxref{Variable
expansion}).  This is a shortcut for

@example
set @var{name} = $@{@var{name}:-""@} ~ @var{s-expr}
@end example

The second form modifies the value of the positional variable
@samp{$@var{n}}.  It is a shortcut for

@example
set [@var{n}] = $@{@var{n}:-""@} ~ @var{s-expr}
@end example

@xref{Transformations}, for more detail on this form.
@end deffn

@cindex s-expression
@anchor{s-expression}
The transformation expression, @var{s-expr}, is @command{sed}-like
replace expression of the form:

@smallexample
s/@var{regexp}/@var{replace}/[@var{flags}]
@end smallexample

@noindent
where @var{regexp} is a @dfn{regular expression}, @var{replace} is a
replacement for each part of the input that matches @var{regexp}.  Both
@var{regexp} and @var{replace} are described in detail in
@ref{The "s" Command, The "s" Command, The `s' Command, sed, GNU sed}.

As in @command{sed}, you can give several replace expressions,
separated by semicolons.

Supported @var{flags} are:

@table @samp
@cindex g, @option{transform} flag
@item g
Apply the replacement to @emph{all} matches to the @var{regexp}, not
just the first.

@cindex i, @option{transform} flag
@item i
Use case-insensitive matching

@cindex x, @option{transform} flag
@item x
@var{regexp} is an @dfn{extended regular expression} (@pxref{Extended
regexps, Extended regular expressions, Extended regular expressions,
sed, GNU sed}).

@item @var{number}
Only replace the @var{number}th match of the @var{regexp}.

Note: the @acronym{POSIX} standard does not specify what should happen
when you mix the @samp{g} and @var{number} modifiers.  @command{Rush}
follows the GNU @command{sed} implementation in this regard, so
the interaction is defined to be: ignore matches before the
@var{number}th, and then match and replace all matches from the
@var{number}th on.
@end table

Notice, that normally the @var{s-expr} is quoted, which means that
it is subject to backslash interpretation.  Consequently, pay attention
to properly escaping the backslash characters in @var{s-expr}, in
particular when using back-references to parenthesized groups in its
@var{regexp} part.

@FIXME{Example!}

@node unset
@subsubsection The @code{unset} statement

@deffn {rule} unset @var{name}
Unsets the variable @var{name}.
@end deffn

@node map
@subsubsection The @code{map} statement

@deffn {rule} map @var{name} @var{file} @var{delim} @var{key} @
        @var{kn} @var{vn}
@deffnx {rule} map [@var{n}] @var{file} @var{delim} @var{key} @
         @var{kn} @var{vn} @var{default}
  The @samp{map} statement uses file lookup to find a new value for
the variable @var{name} (or, in its second form, for the positional
variable @samp{$@var{n}}).

Arguments are:

@table @var
@item file
Name of the @dfn{map file}.  It must begin with @samp{/} or
@samp{~/}.  Before using, the file permissions and ownership are
checked using the procedure described in @ref{security checks}.

@item delim
A string containing allowed field delimiters.

@item key
The value of the lookup key.  Before using, it undergoes backslash
interpretation and variable expansion.

@item kn
Number of the key field in @var{file}.  Fields are numbered starting
from 1.

@item vn
Number of the value field.

@item default
If supplied, this value is used as a replacement value, when the key
was not found in @var{file}.
@end table
@end deffn

  The map file consists of @dfn{records}, separated by newline
characters (in other words, a record occupies one line).  Each record
consists of fields, separated by delimiters, given in @var{delim}
argument.  If @var{delim} contains a space character, then fields may
be delimited by any amount of whitespace characters (spaces and/or
tabulations).  Otherwise, exactly one delimiter delimits fields.

  Fields are numbered starting from 1.

  The @code{map} action works as follows:

@enumerate 1
@item
Variable expansion is performed over the @var{file} argument
(@pxref{Variable expansion}) and the resulting value is used as lookup key.

@item
The @var{file} is scanned for a record whose @var{kn}th field
matches the lookup key.

@item
If such a record is found, the value of its @var{vn}th field is
assigned to the @var{n}th command line word (@pxref{indexing}, for a
description of @var{n}).

@item
Otherwise, if @var{default} is supplied, it becomes the new value of the
@var{n}th word.

@item
Otherwise, the @var{n}th word remains unchanged.
@end enumerate

  For example, suppose that the file @file{/etc/passwd.rush} has the
same syntax as the system @file{passwd} file (@pxref{passwd, Password
File,,passwd(5), passwd(5) man page}).  Then, the following statement
will replace @samp{argv[0]} with the value of @samp{shell} field,
using the current user name as a key:

@smallexample
map [0] /etc/passwd.rush : $@{user@} 1 7
@end smallexample

See also @ref{Interactive}, for another example of using this
statement.

@node Transformations
@subsection Transformations
  Transformations are special commands that modify entire command line
or particular arguments from it (positional variables).

  Statements that modify entire command line have been described in
the previous section: these are @code{set} and @code{map} commands
with @samp{command} given as first argument.

@FIXME{Move the [n] forms here.  Mention re-splitting the command line
after modification and rebuilding it after changes to any of the arguments}.

  Let's consider several examples.

@enumerate 1
@item Echo the command line
@example
rule
  set command = "/bin/echo $command"
@end example

@item This rule first removes all occurrences of @option{-r}
option and its arguments from the command line, and then adds its own
@option{-r} option and replaces @samp{svnserve} with the full program
file name.

@example
rule svn
  match $command ~ "^svnserve -t"
  set command =~ "s/-r *[^ ]*//"
  set command =~ "s|^svnserve |/usr/bin/svnserve -r /svnroot |"
@end example

  Notice the use of @samp{|} as a delimiter in s-command, in order to
avoid escaping each @samp{/} in the pathname.  Without it, the second
@code{set} command will be

@example
  set command =~ "s/^svnserve /\\/usr\\/bin\\/svnserve -r \\/svnroot /"
@end example

@item The same rule, rewritten using the single @command{set} statement:

@example
rule svn
  match $command ~ "^svnserve -t"
  set command =~ "s|-r *[^ ]*||;s|^svnserve |/usr/bin/svnserve -r /svnroot |"
@end example

@item Override the executable program name.

@example
@group
rule cvs
  match $command ~ "^cvs server"
  set [0] = /usr/bin/cvs
@end group
@end example
@end enumerate

Another statement modifying the command line is @code{delete}:

@deffn {rule} delete @var{n}
Delete @var{n}th argument.
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} delete @var{i} @var{j}
Delete all positional arguments between @var{i} and @var{j}.
@end deffn

Neither form can be used to delete the program name (@samp{$0}).

For example, the following statement deletes all arguments from
the command line, except for the program name:

@example
delete 1 -1
@end example

@node System Actions
@subsection System Actions
@cindex system actions
@cindex actions, system

System actions provide an interface to the operating system.

@deffn {rule} umask @var{mask}
Set the umask.  The @var{mask} must be an octal value not greater than
@samp{0777}.  The default umask is @samp{022}.
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} newgrp @var{group-id}
@deffnx {rule} newgroup @var{group-id}
Changes the current group ID to @var{group-id}, which is either a
numeric value or a name of an existing group.
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} chroot @var{dir}
@cindex tilde expansion
Change the root directory to that specified in @var{dir}.  This
directory will be used for file names beginning with @samp{/}.
The argument is subject to tilde, variable, and backreference
expansions.  During tilde expansion, a tilde (@samp{~}) at the start of
string is replaced with the absolute pathname of the user's home
directory.  The two other expansions are described in @ref{Variable
expansion}, and @ref{backreference}.
@end deffn

The directory @var{dir} must be properly set up to execute the
commands.  For example, the following rule defines execution of
@command{sftp-server} in an environment, chrooted to the user's home
directory:

@smallexample
@group
rule sftp
  match $command ~ "^.*/sftp-server"
  set [0] = "bin/sftp-server"
  chroot "~"
@end group
@end smallexample

For this to work, each user's home must contain the directory
@file{bin} with a copy of @file{sftp-server} in it, as well as all
directories and files that are needed for executing it, in particular
@file{lib}.

@anchor{chdir}
@deffn {rule} chdir @var{dir}
Change to the directory @var{dir}.  The argument is subject to
tilde, variable (@pxref{Variable expansion}), and backreference
expansions (@pxref{backreference}).  If both @code{chdir} and
@code{chroot} are specified, then @code{chroot} is applied first.
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} limits @var{res}
Impose limits on system resources, as defined by @var{res}.  The
argument consists of @dfn{commands}, optionally separated by any
amount of whitespace.  A command is a single command letter followed
by a number, that specifies the limit.  The command letters are
case-insensitive and coincide with those used by the shell @code{ulimit}
utility:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.3 0.6
@headitem Command @tab  The limit it sets
@item     A       @tab  max address space (KB)
@item     C       @tab  max core file size (KB)
@item     D       @tab  max data size (KB)
@item     F       @tab  maximum file size (KB)
@item     M       @tab  max locked-in-memory address space (KB)
@item     N       @tab  max number of open files
@item     R       @tab  max resident set size (KB)
@item     S       @tab  max stack size (KB)
@item     T       @tab  max CPU time (MIN)
@item     U       @tab  max number of processes
@item     L       @tab  max number of logins for this user (see below)
@item     P       @tab  process priority -20..20 (negative = high priority)
@end multitable

For example:

@smallexample
limits T10 R20 U16 P20
@end smallexample

@cindex simultaneous sessions
@cindex limiting number of simultaneous sessions
@anchor{L limit}
If some limit cannot be set, execution of the rule aborts.  In
particular, the @samp{L} limit can be regarded as a condition, rather than
an action.  Setting @code{limit L@var{n}} succeeds only if no
more than @var{n} @code{rush} instances are simultaneously running for
the same user.  This can be used to limit the number of simultaneously
open sessions.

The use of @samp{L} resource automatically enables @dfn{forked mode}.
@xref{Accounting and Forked Mode}, for more information about it.
@end deffn

@node Environment
@subsection Environment
@cindex Environment

The following actions modify the environment in which the
program will be executed.

@deffn {rule} clrenv
Clear the environment.
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} keepenv @var{list}
Retain the names in @var{list} in the environment.  This statement
should be used in conjunction with @code{clrenv}.

Argument is a whitespace delimited list of variable names to retain.
A variable name can be followed by an equals sign and a value, in
which case it will be retained only if its actual value equals the
supplied one.
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} setenv @var{name} = @var{value}
Set value to the environment variable @var{name}.  The @var{value}
argument is subject to variable expansion (@pxref{Variable
expansion}).

For example, to modify the @env{PATH} value:

@example
setenv PATH = "$PATH:/opt/bin"
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} unsetenv @var{list}
Unset environment variables listed as arguments.

A variable name can be followed by an equals sign and a value, in
which case it will be unset only if its actual value equals the
supplied one.
@end deffn

@node Fall-through
@subsection Fall-through
@cindex fall-through statement
@cindex fallthrough
The @dfn{fall-through} statement is a special action that does not
execute the requested command.  When a matching fall-through rule is
encountered, @command{rush} evaluates it and continues scanning its
configuration for the next matching rule.  Any modifications to the
request found in the fall-through rule take effect immediately, which
means that subsequent rules will see modified command line and
environment.  Execution of any other actions found in the fall-through
rule is delayed until a usual rule is found. 

A fall-through rule is declared using the following statement:

@deffn {rule} fall-through
@deffnx {rule} fallthrough
Declare a fall-through rule.
@end deffn

Usually this statement is placed as the last statement in a rule, e.g.:

@smallexample
@group
rule default
  umask 002
  clrenv
  keepenv HOME USERNAME PATH
  fall-through
@end group
@end smallexample

Fall-through rules provide a way to set default values for subsequent
rules.  For example, any rules that follow the @samp{default} rule
shown above, will inherit the umask and environment set there.

One can also use fall-through rules to ``normalize'' command lines.
For example, consider this rule:

@smallexample
@group
rule default
  set command =~ "s|.*/||"
  fall-through
@end group
@end smallexample

It will remove all path components from the first command line argument.
As a result, all subsequent rules may expect a bare binary name as the
first argument.

Yet another common use for such rules is to enable accounting (see the
next subsection), or set resource limits for the rest of rules:

@smallexample
@group
rule default
  limit l1
  fall-through
@end group
@end smallexample

@node Accounting and Forked Mode
@subsection Accounting and Forked Mode
@cindex accounting
  GNU Rush is able to operate in two modes, which we call default and
forked.  When operating in the default mode, the process image of
@command{rush} itself is overwritten by the command being executed.
Thus, when it comes to launching the requested command,
the running instance of @command{rush} ceases to exist.

@cindex forked mode
  There is also another operation mode, which we call @dfn{forked
mode}.  When running in this mode, @command{rush} executes the
requested command in a subprocess, and remains in memory supervising
its execution.  Once the command terminates, @command{rush} exits.

  One advantage of the forked mode is that it allows you to keep
@dfn{accounting}, i.e. to note who is doing what and to keep a
history of invocations.  The accounting, in turn, can be used to limit
simultaneous executions of commands (@dfn{logins}, in
GNU Rush terminology), as requested by @samp{L} command to @code{limit}
statement (@pxref{L limit}).

  The forked mode is enabled on a per-rule basis, for rules that
contain either @samp{L} command in the @code{limit} statement, or
@samp{acct on} command:

@deffn {rule} acct @var{bool}
Turn accounting mode on or off, depending on @var{bool}.  The argument
can be one of the following: @samp{yes}, @samp{on}, @samp{t},
@samp{true}, or @samp{1}, to enable accounting, and @samp{no},
@samp{off}, @samp{nil}, @samp{false}, @samp{0}, to disable it.

Notice, that there is no need in explicit @code{acct on} command, if
you use @command{limit L}.
@end deffn

The notion @samp{rule contains}, used above, means that either the
rule in question contains that statement, or inherits it from one
of the fall-through rules (@pxref{Fall-through}) that were matched
before it.  In fact, in most cases the accounting should affect all
rules, therefore we suggest to enable it in a fall-through rule at the
beginning of the configuration file, e.g.:

@smallexample
rule default
  acct on
  fall-through
@end smallexample

If the need be, you can disable it for some of the subsequent rules by
placing @code{acct off} in it.  Notice, that this will disable
accounting only, the forked mode will remain in action.  To disable it
as well and enforce default mode for a given rule, use @code{fork off}
statement:

@deffn {rule} fork @var{bool}
Enable or disable forked mode.  This statement is mainly designed as a
way of disabling the forked mode for a given rule.
@end deffn

  Once accounting is enabled, you can view the list of currently
logged in users using @code{rushwho} command (@pxref{Rushwho}) and
view the history of last logins using @code{rushlast} command
(@pxref{Rushlast}).

@node Notification
@subsection Post-process Notification

  @command{Rush} can be configured to send a @dfn{notification} over
@acronym{INET} or @acronym{UNIX} sockets, after completing user
request.  It is done using the @code{post-socket} statement:

@deffn {rule} post-socket @var{url}
Notify @acronym{URL} about completing the user request.  This statement
implies forked mode (@pxref{Accounting and Forked Mode}).

Allowed formats for @var{url} are:

@table @asis
@item inet://@var{hostname}[:@var{port}]
@cindex tcpmux

Connect to remote host @var{hostname} using TCP/IP.  @var{Hostname} is the
host name or IP address of the remote machine.  Optional @var{port}
specifies the port number to connect to.  It can be either a decimal
port number or a service name from @file{/etc/services}.  If
@var{port} is absent, @samp{tcpmux} (port 1) is assumed.

@item unix://@var{filename}
@itemx local://@var{filename}

Connect to a @acronym{UNIX} socket @var{filename}.
@end table

For example:

@smallexample
@group
rule default
  post-socket "inet://localhost"
@end group
@end smallexample
@end deffn

  The GNU Rush notification protocol is based on @acronym{TCPMUX}
(@uref{http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1078.txt, RFC 1078}).

  After establishing connection, @command{rush} sends the rule tag
followed by a CRLF pair.  The rule tag acts as a service name.  The
remote party replies with a single character indicating positive
(@samp{+}) or negative (@samp{-}) acknowledgment, immediately followed
by an optional message of explanation, terminated with a CRLF.

  If positive acknowledgment is received, @command{rush} sends a
single line, consisting of the user name and the executed command
line, separated by a single space character.  The line is terminated
with a CRLF.

  After sending this line, @command{rush} closes the connection.

  The post-process notification feature can be used to schedule
execution of some actions after certain rules.

  @xref{notification example}, for an example of how to use this
feature.

@node Exit
@subsection Exit rule
@cindex exit rule
  An @dfn{exit} rule does not execute any commands.  Instead, it writes
the supplied error message to the specified file descriptor and exits
immediately.  The exit rule is defined using the following statement:

@deffn {rule} exit @var{fd} @var{message}
@deffnx {rule} exit @var{message}
Write textual message @var{message} to a file descriptor, given by the
optional argument @var{fd}.  If @var{fd} is absent, @samp{2} (standard
error) is used.
@end deffn

The @var{message} argument can be either a quoted string, or an
identifier.

If it is a quoted string, it is subject to backreference
interpretation and variable expansion prior to being used.

For example (note the use of line continuation character):

@smallexample
exit "\
    \r\nYou are not allowed to execute that command.\r\n\
    \r\nIf you think this is wrong, ask <foo@@bar.com> for assistance.\r\n"
@end smallexample

  If @var{message} is an identifier, it must be the name of a
predefined error message (@pxref{Error Messages}).  The corresponding
message text will be printed.  For example:

@smallexample
  exit nologin-message
@end smallexample

  If the identifier does not match any predefined error message name,
an error of type @samp{config-error} is signaled and @command{rush}
exits.

@cindex trap rule
Exit actions are useful for writing @dfn{trap rules}, i.e. the rules that
are intended to trap incorrect or prohibited command lines and to return
customized reply messages in such cases.  Consider the following
rule:

@smallexample
@group
rule git
  match $command ~ "^git-.+" && $1 ~ "^/sources/[^ ]+\.git$"
  set command =~ "s|.*|/usr/bin/git-shell -c \"&\"|"
@end group
@end smallexample

It allows the client to use only those Git repositories that are
located under @file{/sources} directory@footnote{@xref{git}, for a
better way to handle Git accesses.}.  If a user tries to access a
repository outside this root, he will be returned a default error
message, saying @samp{You are not permitted to execute this command}
(@pxref{Error Messages, usage-error}).  You can, however, provide a
more convenient message in this case.  To do so, place the following
after the @samp{git} rule:

@smallexample
@group
rule git-trap
  match $command ~ "^git-.+"
  exit "fatal: Use of this repository is prohibited."
@end group
@end smallexample

This rule will trap all git invocations that do not match the
@samp{git} rule.

@node Interactive
@subsection Interactive Access
@cindex interactive access
  Sometimes it may be necessary to allow some group of users limited
access to interactive shells.  GNU Rush contains provisions for such
usage.  When @command{rush} is invoked without @option{-c} it assumes
interactive usage.  In this case only rules explicitly marked as
interactive are considered, the rest of rules is ignored.

@deffn {rule} interactive @var{bool}
If @var{bool} is @samp{true}, this statement marks the rule it appears
in as interactive.  This rule will match only if @command{rush} is
invoked without command line arguments.
@end deffn

Unless command line transformations are applied, interactive rule
finishes by executing @command{/bin/sh}.  The first word in the
command line (@code{argv[0]}) is normally set to the basename of
the command being executed prefixed by a dash sign.

Consider the following example:

@smallexample
rule login
  interactive true
  group rshell
  map program /etc/rush.shell : $@{user@} 1 2
  set [0] = $@{program@} ~ "s,^,-r,"

rule nologin
  interactive true
  exit You don't have interactive access to this machine.
@end smallexample

The @samp{login} rule will match interactive user requests if the user
is a member of the group @samp{rshell}.  It uses
@file{/etc/rush.shell} to select a shell to use for that user
(@pxref{map}).  This map file consists of two fields, separated by a
colon.  If the shell is found, its base name, prefixed with @samp{-r},
will be used as @samp{argv[0]} (this indicates a restricted login shell).
Otherwise, the trap rule @samp{nologin} will be matched, which will
output the given diagnostics message and terminate @command{rush}.

To test interactive access, use the @option{-i} option:

@smallexample
rush --test -i
@end smallexample

@node Localization
@subsection Localization
@cindex i18n
@cindex internationalization
@cindex l10n
@cindex localization
  GNU Rush is internationalized, which means that it is able to
produce log and diagnostic messages in any language, if a
corresponding translation file is provided.  This file is called a
@dfn{localization} or @dfn{domain} file.  To find an appropriate
localization file, @command{rush} uses the following parameters:

@table @var
@cindex locale name
@item locale
@dfn{Locale name} is a string that describes the language, territory
and optionally, the character set to use.  It consists of the language
(ISO 639) and country (ISO 3166) codes, separated by an underscore
character, e.g.  @samp{en_US} or @samp{pl_PL}.  If a character set is
specified, its name follows the country code and is separated from it
by a @samp{@@} character.

There are two special locale names: @samp{C} or @samp{POSIX} mean to
use the default @acronym{POSIX} locale, and @samp{""} (an empty
string), means to use the value of the environment variable
@env{LC_ALL} as the locale name.

@cindex locale directory
@item locale_dir
Directory where localization files are located.  If not specified, a
predefined set of directories is searched for the matching file.

@cindex domain, localization
@cindex textual domain
@item domain
@dfn{Text domain} defines the base name of the localization file.
@end table

@anchor{mo-name}
Given these parameters, the name of the full pathname of the
localization file is defined as:

@smallexample
@var{locale_dir}/@var{locale}/LC_MESSAGES/@var{domain}.mo
@end smallexample

GNU Rush produces three kinds of messages:

@table @asis
@item diagnostics
These are diagnostics messages that GNU Rush produces to its log output
(syslog, unless in test mode).

@item error messages
Messages sent to the remote party when @command{rush} is not able to
execute the request (@pxref{Error Messages}).

@item exit messages
These are messages sent to the remote party by @code{exit} rules
(@pxref{Exit}).
@end table

These messages use different domain names (and may use different
locale directories).  The diagnostics and error messages use textual
domain @samp{rush}.  The corresponding locale directory is defined at
compile time and defaults to @file{@var{prefix}/share/locale}, where
@var{prefix} stands for the installation prefix, which is
@file{/usr/local}, by default.

GNU Rush is shipped with several localization files, which are installed
by default.  As of version @value{VERSION}, these files cover the
following languages: Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, Galician,
German, Polish, Portuguese, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese.  If the localization you need is not in this list, visit
@uref{http://translationproject.org/domain/rush.html}.  If it is not
there either, consider writing it (see @ref{Translators,,,gettext, GNU
gettext utilities}, for a detailed instructions on how to do that).

Exit messages use custom domain files.  It is the responsibility of
the system administrator to provide and install such files.

@menu
* Localization Directives::
* Writing Your Localization::
@end menu

@node Localization Directives
@subsubsection Localization Directives
@cindex localization directives

The following configuration directives control localization.  They
are available for use in @code{rule} statements:

@deffn {rule} locale @var{name}
Sets the locale name.  To specify empty locale, use @samp{""} as
@var{name} (recall that empty locale name means to use the value of the
environment variable @env{LC_ALL} as locale name).
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} locale-dir @var{name}
Sets the name of the locale directory.
@end deffn

@deffn {rule} text-domain @var{name}
Sets the textual domain name.
@end deffn

The following configuration fragment illustrates their use:

@smallexample
@group
rule l10n
  locale "pl_PL"
  text-domain "rush-config"
  fall-through
@end group
@end smallexample

Different users may have different localization
preferences.  @xref{per-user l10n}, for a description of how to
implement this.

@node Writing Your Localization
@subsubsection Writing Your Localization
  You need to write a localization file for your configuration script
if it implements exit rules (@pxref{Exit}) and changes user locale
(@pxref{Localization Directives, locale}).

  Preparing localization consists of three stages: extracting exit
messages and forming a @acronym{PO} file, editing this file, compiling and
installing it.  The discussion below describes these stages in detail.

@enumerate 1
@item Creating a @samp{po} file.

  A @acronym{PO} (@dfn{Portable Object}) file is a plain text file,
containing original messages and their translations for a particular
language.  @xref{PO Files, The Format of PO Files,,gettext, GNU
gettext utilities}, for a description of its format.

@cindex rush-po
@anchor{rush-po}
  The script @command{rush-po} extracts translatable messages from the
configuration file and produces a valid @acronym{PO} file.  It takes
the name of the rush configuration file as its argument and produces
the PO file on the standard output, or in the file given with the
@option{-o} (@option{--output}) option.  E.g., to create a PO file
from your configuration file, run:

@smallexample
rush-po -o myconf.po /usr/local/etc/rush.rc
@end smallexample

@item Editing the @acronym{PO} file

Open the created @acronym{PO} file with your favorite editor and supply
message translations after @code{msgstr} keywords.  Although you can
use any editor capable of handling plain text files, we recommend to
use GNU Emacs, which provides a special @dfn{po-mode}.  @xref{Basics,
PO Files and PO Mode Basics,,gettext, GNU gettext utilities}, for guidelines
on editing @acronym{PO} files and using the po-mode.

@item Compiling the @acronym{PO} file

@pindex msgfmt
When ready, the @acronym{PO} file needs be compiled into a
@acronym{MO} (@dfn{Message Object}) file, which is directly readable
by @command{rush}.  This is done using @command{msgfmt} utility from
GNU gettext:

@smallexample
  msgfmt -o myconf.mo myconf.po
@end smallexample

@xref{msgfmt Invocation,,,gettext, GNU gettext utilities}, for a
detailed description of the @command{msgfmt} utility.

After creating the @acronym{MO} file, copy it into appropriate
directory.  It is important that the installed @acronym{MO} file uses
the naming scheme described in @ref{mo-name, localization file
naming}.
@end enumerate

@node Include
@section Include
@UNREVISED
@cindex include
  The @code{include} statement forces inclusion of the named file in
that file location:

@deffn {rule} include @var{file}
Include file @var{file}.
@end deffn

@cindex tilde expansion
The statement is evaluated when parsing the configuration file,
which means that @var{file} undergoes only @dfn{tilde expansion}:
if it starts with a tilde character, followed by
a slash (@samp{~/}), these two characters are replaced with the
full path name of the current user's home directory.

If @var{file} is a directory, that directory is searched for a file
whose name coincides with the current user name.  If such a file is
found, it is included.

In any case, if the file named by @var{file} (after tilde expansion)
does not exist, no error is reported, and parsing of the configuration
file continues.

Before including the file @command{rush} checks if it is secure, using
the same rules as for the main configuration file (@pxref{security
checks}).  The exact list of checks can be tuned using the
@code{include-security} statement (@pxref{include-security}).

The @code{include} statement can be used only within a rule.  The
included file may not contain @code{rule} and @code{global} statements.

This statement provides a convenient way for user-dependent
@command{rush} configuration.  For example, the following fall-through
rule (@pxref{Fall-through}) allows the administrator to keep each
user's configuration in a file named @file{.rush}, located in the
user's home directory:

@smallexample
@group
rule user
  include "~/.rush"
  fall-through
@end group
@end smallexample

Of course, it is supposed that such a per-user file, if it exists, is
writable only for super-user.

@anchor{per-user l10n}
The use of include files may be especially useful for per-user
localization (@pxref{Localization}).  It suffices to provide a
fall-through rule, similar to the one above, and to place a
@code{locale} directive in @file{~/.rush} files, according to the
users' preferences.

@node Default Configuration
@chapter Default Configuration
@UNREVISED

You can compile @command{rush} with the default configuration built in
the binary.  Such a binary can then be run without configuration file.
However, if a configuration file is present, it will be used instead of
the built-in configuration.

To compile @command{rush} with the built-in configuration, first
compile the package as usual.  Then, prepare a configuration file, and
test it using @command{rush --lint}.  If the test shows no errors,
reconfigure the package, using the @option{--with-default-config}
option:

@smallexample
  ./configure --with-default-config=@var{file}
@end smallexample

@noindent
where @var{file} is the name of your configuration file.  Then,
recompile and install the package.

@opindex --show-default
You can inspect the built-in configuration using the
@option{--show-default} option:

@smallexample
  rush --show-default
@end smallexample

@node Usage Tips
@chapter Usage Tips
In this chapter we will explain how to write GNU Rush configuration rules
for several popular remote copy and version control system
utilities.  For this purpose, we assume the following setup:

@itemize @bullet
@item Users are allowed to use @code{scp} and @code{rsync} to upload
files to the @file{/incoming} directory and to copy files to and from
their @file{~/public_html} directory.
The @file{/incoming} directory is located on server in @file{/home/ftp}
directory, but that is transparent to users, i.e. they use
@code{scp @var{file} @var{host}:/incoming} (not
@code{@var{host}:/home/ftp/incoming}) to upload files.

@item Additionally, users may use @command{sftp} to manage their
@file{~/public_html} directory.  In this case, to prevent users from
accessing other directories, @command{sftp-server} is executed in a
chrooted environment.

@item The server runs three version control system repositories, whose
corresponding repositories are located in the following directories:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.3 0.7
@headitem VCS @tab Repository Root
@item cvs     @tab /cvsroot
@item svn     @tab /svnroot
@item git     @tab /gitroot
@end multitable
@end itemize

@menu
* scp::
* rsync::
* sftp::
* cvs::
* svn::
* git::
* notification example::
@end menu

@node scp
@section scp
@cindex scp
The @code{scp} utility is executed on the server side
with option @option{-t}, when copying files to server, and with
@option{-f} when copying from it.  Thus, the basic templates for
@code{scp} rules are:

@smallexample
# Copying to server:
rule scp-to
  match $command ~ "^scp -t"
  ...

# Copying from server:
rule scp-from
  match $command ~ "^scp -f"
  ...
@end smallexample

You may also wish to allow for @option{-v} (@samp{verbose}) command
line option.  In this case, the @samp{scp-to} rule will become:

@smallexample
rule scp-to
  match $command ~ "^scp (-v )?-t"
  ...
@end smallexample

First, we want users to be able to upload files to
@file{/home/ftp/incoming} directory.  Moreover, the @file{/home/ftp}
directory prefix must be invisible to them.  We should also make sure
that the user cannot get outside the @file{incoming} directory by using
@file{../} components in his upload path.  So, our first rule for
@code{scp} uploads will be:

@smallexample
rule scp-to-incoming
  match $command ~ "^scp (-v )?-t /incoming/" && $@{-1@} !~ "\\.\\./"
  set command "/bin/scp"
  set [-1] =~ "s|^|/home/ftp/|"
@end smallexample

The @code{match} statement ensures that no relative components are
used.  Two transform rules ensure that the right @command{scp} binary
is used and that @file{/home/ftp} prefix is prepended to the upload
path.

Other than uploading to @file{/incoming}, users must be able to use
@command{scp} to manage @file{public_html} directories located in
their homes.  They should use relative paths for that, i.e., the
command:

@smallexample
$ scp file.html server:
@end smallexample

@noindent
will copy file @file{file.html} to @file{~/public_html/file.html} on
the server.  The corresponding rule is:

@smallexample
rule scp-home
  match $command ~ "^scp (-v )?-[tf] [^/].*" && $@{-1@} !~ "\\.\\./"
  set [0] = "/bin/scp"
  set [-1] =~ "s|^|public_html/|"
  chdir "~"
@end smallexample

Finally, we provide two trap rules for diagnostic purposes:

@smallexample
rule scp-to-trap
  match $command ~ "^scp (-v )?-t"
  exit "Error: Uploads to this directory prohibited"

rule scp-from
  match $command ~ "^scp (-v )?-f"
  exit Error: Downloads from this directory prohibited
@end smallexample

@node rsync
@section rsync
@cindex rsync
On the server side, @command{rsync} is executed with the
@option{--server} command line option.  In addition, when copying
files from the server, the @option{--sender} option is used.  This
makes it possible to discern between incoming and outgoing requests.

In our setup, @command{rsync} is used the same way as @command{scp}, so
the two rules will be:

@smallexample
rule rsync-incoming
  match $command ~ "^rsync --server" && $command !~ --sender \
        && $@{-1@} ~ "/incoming/" && $@{-1@} !~ "\\.\\./"
  set [0] =~ "s|^|/usr/bin/|"
  set [-1] =~ "s|^|/home/ftp/|"

rule rsync-home
  match $command ~ "^rsync" && $@{-1@} !~ "^[^/]" && $@{-1@} !~ "\\.\\./"
  set [0] = "s|^|/usr/bin/|"
  set [-1] =~ "s|^|public_html/|"
  chdir "~"
@end smallexample

The trap rules for @command{rsync} are trivial:

@smallexample
rule rsync-to-trap
  match $command ~ "^rsync.*--sender"
  exit "Error: Downloads from this directory prohibited"

rule rsync-from-trap
  match $command ~ "^rsync"
  exit "Error: Uploads to this directory prohibited"
@end smallexample

@node sftp
@section sftp
@cindex sftp
Executing @command{sftp} on the client machine invokes
@command{sftp-server}, without arguments, on the server.

We want to allow our users to use @command{sftp} to manage their
@file{public_html} directories.  The @command{sftp-server} will be
executed with the user's home directory as root, in a chrooted
environment.  For this to work, each user's home must contain a copy
of @command{sftp-server} (which we'll place in @file{~/bin}
subdirectory) and all files it needs for normal execution:
@file{/etc/group} and @file{/etc/passwd} with one entry
(for the user and his group), and, unless the binary is linked
statically, all the shared libraries it is linked with, in the
subdirectory @file{~/lib}.

Given these prerequisites, the following rule will ensure proper
@command{sftp} interaction:

@smallexample
rule sftp-incoming
  match $command ~ "^.*/sftp-server"
  set [0] = "/bin/sftp-server"
  chroot "~"
  chdir "public_html"
@end smallexample

Notice the last action.  Due to it, users don't have to type @code{cd
public_html} at the beginning of their sftp sessions.

@node cvs
@section cvs
@cindex cvs
@UNREVISED
@FIXME{CVS is rarely used nowadays, so the utility of this section is
doubtful.  Rewrite it using some more widely used VCS (hg, for example)}.
Using @command{cvs} over @code{ssh} invokes @command{cvs server} on
the server machine.  In the simplest case, the following rule will do
to give users access to @acronym{CVS} repositories:

@smallexample
@group
rule cvs
  match $command ~ "^cvs server"
  set command ~ "s|^cvs|/usr/bin/cvs -f"
@end group
@end smallexample

However, @command{cvs} as of version 1.12.13 does not allow to limit root
directories that users are allowed to access.  It does have
@option{--allow-root} option, but unfortunately this option is ignored when
invoked as @command{cvs server}.  To restrict possible roots, we have
to run @command{cvs} in a chrooted environment.  Let's suppose we
created an environment for @command{cvs} in directory @file{/var/cvs},
with the @command{cvs} binary located in @file{/var/cvs/bin} and
repository root directory being @file{/var/cvs/cvsroot}.  Then, we can
use the following rule:

@smallexample
rule cvs
  match $command ~ "^cvs server"
  set [0] = "/bin/cvs"
  chroot "/var/cvs"
@end smallexample

@node svn
@section svn
@cindex svn
Remote access to @acronym{SVN} repositories is done via
@command{svnserve} binary.  It is executed on server with @option{-t}
option.  The @option{-r} option can be used to restrict access to a
subset of root directories.  So, we can use the following rule:

@smallexample
@group
rule svn
  match $command ~ "^svnserve -t"
  set command =~ "s|-r *[^ ]*||"
  set command =~ "s|^svnserve |/usr/bin/svnserve -r /svnroot|"
@end group
@end smallexample

First @code{set command} action removes any @option{-r} options the user
might have specified and enforces a single root directory.  A more
restrictive action can be used to improve security:

@smallexample
  set command =~ "s|.*|/usr/bin/svnserve -r /svnroot|"
@end smallexample

@node git
@section git
@cindex git
@cindex git-receive-pack
@cindex git-upload-pack
@cindex git-shell
Remote access to Git repositories over ssh causes execution of
@code{git-receive-pack} and @code{git-upload-pack} on the server.
The simplest rule for Git is:

@smallexample
@group
rule git
  set $command ~ "^git-(receive|upload)-pack"
  set [0] =~ "s|^|/usr/bin/|"
@end group
@end smallexample

The @code{transform} action is necessary to ensure the proper location
of Git binaries to use.  This example supposes they are placed in
@file{/usr/bin}, you will have to tailor it if they are located
elsewhere on your system.

To limit Git accesses to repositories under @file{/gitroot} directory,
modify the @samp{$1}, as shown in the example below:

@smallexample
@group
rule git
  match $command ~ "^git-(receive|upload)-pack"
  set [1] =~ "^/gitroot[^ ]+\.git$"
  set [0] =~ "s|^|/usr/bin/|"
@end group
@end smallexample

To provide more helpful error messages, you may follow this rule by a
trap rule (@pxref{Exit, trap rules}):

@smallexample
@group
# @r{Trap the rest of Git requests:}
rule git-trap
  match $command ~ "^git-.+"
  exit "fatal: access to this repository is denied."
@end group
@end smallexample

@node notification example
@section Notification
  In this section we will show how to set up a mail notification for
Rush rules.  Let's suppose we wish to receive emails for each upload
by @code{scp-to} rule (@pxref{scp}).  To do so, we add the following
fall through rule to the beginning of @file{rush.rc}:

@smallexample
rule default
  post-socket "inet://localhost"
  fall-trough
@end smallexample

This will enable notifications for each rule located below this one.
Missing port in @code{post-socket} statement means @command{rush} will
be using the default @samp{tcpmux} port.

To receive and process these requests, you will need an
@command{inetd} capable to handle @acronym{TCPMUX}.  We recommend the
one from GNU Inetutils package
(@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils, GNU Inetutils}).  In
@file{/etc/inetd.conf} file, we add:

@smallexample
# @r{Enable @acronym{TCPMUX} handling}.

@end smallexample

The program @command{/bin/rushmail} does the actual notification.
Following is its simplest implementation:

@smallexample
#! /bin/sh

read user command

To: <root@@localhost>
Subject: GNU Rush notification

Be informed that $user executed $command.

@node Test Mode
@chapter Test Mode
@cindex test mode
@cindex testing configuration file
@cindex configuration file, testing
@opindex --test
@opindex --lint
@opindex -c
  GNU Rush provides a special @dfn{test mode}, intended to test
configuration files and to emulate execution of commands.  Test
mode is enabled by @option{--test} command line option (aliases:
@option{--lint}, @option{-t}).  When @command{rush} is given this option, the
following occurs:

@enumerate 1
@item All diagnostic messages are redirected to standard error, instead of
syslog.

@item If a single non-option argument is present, it is taken as a
name of the configuration file to use.

@item The configuration file is parsed.  If parsing fails, the program
exits with the code 1.

@item If the @option{-c} option is present, @command{rush} processes
its argument as usual (@pxref{Operation}), except that the command
itself is not executed.

@item Otherwise, if @option{-i} option is present, @command{rush}
emulates interactive usage, but does not execute the final command.
@end enumerate

An exit status of 0 means no errors, 1 means an error has occurred.

@opindex --user
@opindex -u
You can also emulate access by a particular user, by supplying his
user name via the @option{--user} (@option{-u}) option.  This option
implies @option{--test}.

@opindex --debug
@opindex -d
In test mode, you can set debugging level (@pxref{Debugging}) from the
command line, using the @option{--debug} (@option{-d}) command line
option.  It expects a single number specifying debugging level as its
argument.  The debugging level set this way overrides settings
from the configuration file.

  Here are several examples that illustrate the use of test mode
in various cases:

@enumerate 1
@item Test default configuration file:

@smallexample
$ rush --test
@end smallexample

@item Test configuration file @file{sample.rc}:

@smallexample
$ rush --test sample.rc
@end smallexample

@item Test interactive access

@smallexample
$ rush --test -i sample.rc
@end smallexample

@item Test the configuration file and emulate execution of the command
@command{cvs server}.  Use debugging level 2:

@smallexample
$ rush --test --debug=2 -c "cvs server"
@end smallexample

@item Same, but for user @samp{jeff}:

@smallexample
$ rush --user=jeff --debug=2 -c "cvs server"
@end smallexample

Note, that you don't need to specify @option{--test} along with
@option{--user} or @option{-i} options.

@item Same, but use @file{sample.rc} instead of the default
configuration file:

@smallexample
$ rush --test --debug=2 -c "cvs server" sample.rc
@end smallexample
@end enumerate

@menu
* dump mode::
@end menu

@node dump mode
@section Dump Mode
@cindex dump mode
Dump mode is similar to test mode.  The main difference is that in
this mode, @command{rush} dumps to the standard output a description of
the user request after performing all checks and transformations.

@opindex --dump
@opindex -D
The mode is requested by the @option{--dump=@var{attr}} (@option{-D
@var{attr}}) option.  The argument @var{attr} is a comma-separated list
of the names of attributes to be included in the dump, or the word
@samp{all}, standing for all attributes.

Additional options and arguments are the same as for the
@option{--test} option.

The description is formatted as a JSON object@footnote{Well, almost.
It diverges from the JSON standard in that slash characters are not
escaped in string objects.} with the following attributes.  These are
also the allowed values for the @var{attr} list:

@table @asis
@kwindex cmdline, dump attribute
@item cmdline
Command line after transformations.

@kwindex argv, dump attribute
@item argv
Array of command line arguments after transformations.

@kwindex prog, dump attribute
@item prog
Name of the program to be executed.  If @samp{null}, @code{argv[0]}
will be used.

@kwindex interactive, dump attribute
@item interactive
@samp{0} for normal requests, @samp{1} for interactive requests.

@kwindex pw_name, dump attribute
@item pw_name
Name of the user from the system user database.

@kwindex pw_uid, dump attribute
@item pw_uid
UID of the user.

@kwindex pw_gid, dump attribute
@item pw_gid
GID of the user.

@kwindex pw_dir, dump attribute
@item pw_dir
Home directory of the user, as set in the system user database.

@kwindex umask, dump attribute
@item umask
Value of the umask (octal).

@kwindex chroot_dir, dump attribute
@item chroot_dir
Chroot directory.

@kwindex home_dir, dump attribute
@item home_dir
Current working directory.

@kwindex gid, dump attribute
@item gid
New GID as set by the @code{newgrp} action, or @samp{-1} if
unchanged.

@kwindex fork, dump attribute
@item fork
Fork mode.  It is a three-state attribute: @samp{0} meaning
@dfn{disabled}, @samp{1} meaning @dfn{enabled}, and @samp{-1} meaning
@dfn{default state}.

@kwindex acct, dump attribute
@item acct
Accounting mode.  See @samp{fork}, for a description of possible
values.

@kwindex text_domain, dump attribute
@item text_domain
Textual domain for i18n.

@kwindex localedir, dump attribute
@item localedir
Locale directory for i18n.

@kwindex locale, dump attribute
@item locale
Locale name

@kwindex environ, dump attribute
@item environ
Dump of the environment (array of assignments).

@kwindex vars, dump attribute
@item vars

@node Formats
@section Output Formats
@cindex output formats

A format string controls the output of every record from GNU Rush
accounting database.  It may contain following four types of objects:

@table @asis
@item Ordinary characters
These are copied to the output verbatim.

@item Escapes
An escape is a backslash (@samp{\\}), followed by a single character.
It is interpreted as follows:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.30 .5
@item Escape @tab Output
@item \a @tab Audible bell character (@acronym{ASCII} 7)
@item \b @tab Backspace character (@acronym{ASCII} 8)
@item \e @tab Escape character (@acronym{ASCII} 27)
@item \f @tab Form-feed character (@acronym{ASCII} 12)
@item \n @tab Newline character (@acronym{ASCII} 10)
@item \r @tab Carriage return character (@acronym{ASCII} 13)
@item \t @tab Horizontal tabulation character (@acronym{ASCII} 9)
@item \v @tab Vertical tabulation character (@acronym{ASCII} 11)
@item \\ @tab A single backslash (@samp{\})
@item \" @tab A double-quote.
@end multitable

Any escape not listed in the table above results in its second
character being output.

@item Quoted strings
Strings are delimited by single or double quotes.  Within a string
any escape sequences are interpreted as described above.

@item Format specifications
A @dfn{format specification} is a kind of function, which outputs
a particular piece of information from the database record.
@end table

Each format specification starts with an opening brace and ends with
a closing brace.  The first word after the brace is the name of the
format specification.  Remaining words are @dfn{positional arguments}
followed by @dfn{keyword arguments}.  Both are optional.  When
specified, keyword arguments must follow positional ones.  A keyword
argument begins with a colon.  For example:

@table @code
@item (time)
A single format specification.

@item (time 10)
The same format specification with the output width limited to 10
characters.

@item (time 10 Duration)
The @samp{time} format specification, with the output width limited to 10
characters and @samp{Duration} as a header title.

@item (time 10 "Session Duration" :right :format %H:%M)
The same with two keyword arguments: @samp{:right} and
@samp{:format}.  The latter takes the string @samp{%H:%M} as its
argument.  Notice the use of quoted string to preserve the
whitespace.
@end table

A full list of format specifications follows.

@deffn {Format Spec} newline [@var{count}]
Causes the newline character to be output.  If the optional @var{count}
is supplied, that many newlines will be printed
@end deffn

@deffn {Format Spec} tab [@var{num}]
Advance to the next tab stop in the output stream.  If optional @var{num}
is present, then skip @var{num} tab stops.  Each tab stop is eight
characters long.
@end deffn

The following specifications output particular fields of a database
record.  They all take two positional arguments: @var{width} and
@var{title}.

The first argument, @var{width} sets the maximum output
length for this specification.  If the number of characters actually output
is less than the width, they will be padded with whitespace either to
the left or to the right, depending on the presence of the @code{:right}
keyword argument.  If the number of characters is greater than
@var{width}, they will be truncated to fit.  If @var{width} is
not given, the field is output as is.

The second argument, @var{title}, gives the title of this column for
the heading line.  By default no title is output.

Every field specification accepts at least two keyword arguments.
The keyword @code{:right} may be used to request alignment to the right
for the data.  This keyword is ignored if @var{width} is not given.

The keyword @code{:empty} followed by a string instructs @command{rushwho}
to output that string if the resulting value for this specification
would otherwise be empty.

@deffn {Format Spec} user @var{width} @var{title} [:empty @var{repl}][:right]
Print the user login name.
@end deffn

@deffn {Format Spec} time @var{width} @var{title} @
       [:empty @var{repl}] [:right] [:format @var{date-format}]
@deffnx {Format Spec} start-time @var{width} @var{title} @
       [:empty @var{repl}] [:right] [:format @var{date-format}]

Date and time when the session started.

The @code{:format} keyword introduces the @code{strftime} format string
to be used when converting the date for printing.  The default value is
@samp{%a %H:%M}.  @xref{Time and Date Formats}, for a detailed
description of @code{strftime} format strings.
@end deffn

@deffn {Format Spec} stop-time @var{width} @var{title} @
        [:empty @var{repl}] [:right] [:format @var{date-format}]
Time when the command finished.  This specifier is meaningful only for
@command{rushlast} (@pxref{Rushlast}).  If the command is still
running, the word @samp{running} is output.
@end deffn

@deffn {Format Spec} duration @var{width} @var{title} @
       [:empty @var{repl}] [:right]
Total time of the session duration.
@end deffn

@deffn {Format Spec} rule @var{width} @var{title} [:right]
The tag of the rule used to serve the user.  @xref{Rule, tag}, for a
detailed description of rules and tags.
@end deffn

@deffn {Format Spec} command @var{width} @var{title} @
       [:empty @var{repl}] [:right]
Command line being executed.
@end deffn

@deffn {Format Spec} pid @var{width} @var{title} [:right]
PID of the process.
@end deffn

For example, the following is the default format for the
@command{rushwho} utility.  It is written in a form, suitable for use
in a file supplied with the @option{--format=@@@var{file}} command
line option (@pxref{format option}):

@smallexample

@node Accounting Database
@chapter Accounting Database
@cindex accounting database
  Rush accounting database is stored in the directory
@file{@var{localstatedir}/rush}, where @var{localstatedir} stands for
the name of the local state directory, defined at compile time.  By
default, it is @file{@var{prefix}/var}, where @var{prefix} is the
installation prefix, which defaults to @file{/usr/local}.  Thus, the
default database directory is @file{/usr/local/var/rush}.  You can
change this default using the @option{--localstatedir} option to
@command{configure} before compiling the package.  The
@option{--prefix} option affects it as well.

@cindex @file{utmp} file, accounting database
@cindex @file{wtmp} file, accounting database
  As of version @value{VERSION}, the database consists of two files,
called @file{utmp} and @file{wtmp}.  The @file{wtmp} file keeps
information about all user sessions, both finished and still active.
The @file{utmp} file contains indices to those records in @file{wtmp},
which represent active sessions.

  The @file{wtmp} grows continuously, while @file{utmp} normally
grows the first day or two after enabling accounting mode, and from then on
its size remains without changes.  If you set up log file rotation,
e.g. by using @command{logrotate} (@pxref{logrotate,,logrotate,logrotate(8),
logrotate man page}), or a similar tool, it is safe to rotate
@file{wtmp} without notifying @command{rush}.  The only requirement is
to truncate @file{utmp} to zero size after rotating @file{wtmp}, as
shown in the following @file{logrotate.conf} snippet:

@smallexample
/var/run/rush/wtmp @{
    monthly
    create 0640 root svusers
    postrotate
      cat /dev/null > /var/run/rush/utmp
    endscript
@}
@end smallexample

  Accounting files are owned by @samp{root} and normally have permissions
@samp{600}.  You may change the default permissions using the
following global configuration file statements:

@deffn {global} acct-umask @var{mask}
Set umask used when accessing accounting database files.  Default
value is @samp{022}.
@end deffn

@deffn {global} acct-dir-mode @var{mode}
Set mode bits for the accounting directory.  The @var{mode} argument
is the mode in octal.
@end deffn

@deffn {global} acct-file-mode @var{mode}
Set mode bits for @file{wtmp} and @file{utmp} files.
@end deffn

  Notice, that these statements affect file and directory modes only
when the corresponding file or directory is created.  @command{Rush}
will not change modes of the existing files.

  The following sections contain a detailed description of the
structure of these two files.  You may skip them, if you are not
interested in technical details.

* wtmp::        The Structure of @file{wtmp} File.
* utmp::        The Structure of @file{wtmp} File.
@end menu

@node wtmp
@section The @file{wtmp} file
@cindex @file{wtmp}
  The @file{wtmp} file consists of variable-size entries.  It is
designed so that it can easily be read in both directions.

  Each record begins with a fixed-size header, which is followed by
three zero-terminated strings, and the record size in @code{size_t}
representation.  The three strings are, in that order: the user login
name, the rule tag, and the full command line.

  The header has the following structure:

@smallexample
@group
struct rush_wtmp @{
        size_t reclen;
        pid_t pid;
        struct timeval start;
        struct timeval stop;
        char *unused[3];
@};
@end group
@end smallexample

@noindent
where:

@table @code
@item reclen
is the length of the entire record, including the size of this
header.  This field is duplicated at the end of the record.

@item pid
is the PID of the command executed for the user.

@item start
represents the time of the beginning of the user session.

@item stop
represents the time when the user session finished.  If the session is
still running, this field is filled with zeros.

@item unused
The three pointers at the end of the structure are used internally by
@command{rush}.  On disk, these fields are always filled with zeros.
@end table

@node utmp
@section The @file{utmp} file
@cindex @file{utmp}
  The @file{utmp} file consists of a fixed-size records of the
following structure:

@smallexample
@group
struct rush_utmp @{
        int status;
        off_t offset;
@};
@end group
@end smallexample

The fields have the following meaning:

@table @code
@item status
Status of the record: @samp{0} if the record is unused, and @samp{1}
if it represents an active session.

@item offset
Offset to the corresponding record in @file{wtmp} (see previous
section).
